Shiva Sutra, also known as Ak攷므ra sam캐mn캐ya, it refers to a set of 14 aphorisms devised as an arrangement of the sounds of Sanskrit for grammatical exposition by P캐攷ini.

I developed a web app to make it interesting to learn Shiva sutra. Your challenge is to arrange the tiles,  with either aphorisms or aksharas (alphabets), of this sliding puzzle in the correct order.

As a clue you can listen any number of times to an audio clip (from Matheson Trust) reciting the Shiva sutra. In the process of solving it you would implicitly memorize the sutra without realising that you 
are, which is the idea behind this game.

You can use Devanagari, Kannada, Telugu or Latin based IAST scripts in this challenge.

You can share your results the number of moves it took you to solve the sliding puzzle and the initial arrangement of tiles as a matrix of coloured squares.
